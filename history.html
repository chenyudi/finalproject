         <div class="jj">
            The history of Thanksgiving in the United States dates back to the early 17th century when a group of English Pilgrims, seeking religious freedom, arrived at Plymouth, Massachusetts, aboard the Mayflower in 1620. These Pilgrims faced a challenging first winter, with many succumbing to illness and harsh conditions.

            <br>In the fall of 1621, the Pilgrims, who had managed to survive with the help of Native Americans, particularly the Wampanoag tribe, decided to celebrate a bountiful harvest and give thanks. The Native Americans, particularly Squanto, had taught the Pilgrims essential agricultural techniques, such as how to cultivate corn and other crops.
            <br>The three-day feast that followed is often considered the first Thanksgiving. It was a communal event where Pilgrims and Native Americans came together to share food and express gratitude for the successful harvest and the help they received in surviving in the New World. It's important to note that while this event is often cited as the origin of Thanksgiving, similar harvest celebrations were common in different cultures and regions long before the Pilgrims arrived. The idea of setting aside time to give thanks for a good harvest or blessings is a tradition with deep historical roots.

                  Each year, the President of the United States participates in the National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation. This tradition involves the president "pardoning" a live turkey, sparing it from being part of the Thanksgiving dinner. The pardoned turkey is then sent to live out its days on a farm. This practice, while official since 1989, has some humorous elements as the president often delivers tongue-in-cheek remarks about the turkey's crimes and rehabilitation.

                     Thanksgiving parades are known for their elaborate floats and giant balloons, but they don't always go as planned. Over the years, there have been amusing incidents, including balloons getting caught in trees or strong winds causing them to go off course. These unexpected events add an element of unpredictability to the parades and often become memorable moments.
